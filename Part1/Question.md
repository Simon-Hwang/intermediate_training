## By clicking on a cell containing a bug, flower, or rock, do the following.
1.  Test the setDirection method with the following inputs and complete the table, giving the compass direction each input represents.

    | Degrees | Compass Direction |
    | --- | --- |

    | 45 |  NorthEast|
    | 90 |  East |

    | 225 | SouthWest  |
    | 270 | West  |
    | 315 | NorthWest  |
    | 360 |  North |

2.  Move a bug to a different location using the moveTo method. In which directions can you move it? How far can you move it? What happens if you try to move the bug outside the grid?
